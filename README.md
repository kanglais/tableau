# Data Analysis for Tableau

This project includes a short script to clean up data for Udacity's Tableau / Data Visualization project. Project & drafts can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kellie6768#!/).

### Data Description

The data subsists of details concering passengers aboard the Titanic, including social class, gender, and whether or not they survived. This project was done for data visualization purposes, to examine the factors that would determine whether or not a passenger would survive. 

### Code

The code is a very simple script that uses the Pandas library to change one particular column of the data from a number to a boolean- 'Survived'. Survivors were given a 1 or a 0, depending on whether or not they successfully made it off the ship. The script also does some basic cleaning.
